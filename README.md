Welcome, Future Collaborators!
üéâ Welcome to the interactive activity for our "GitHub for Beginners" session! üéâ

The goal of this project is simple: to collaboratively create an awesome list of learning resources for people new to tech. By adding your favorite resource, you will complete the full GitHub workflow and make your very first open-source contribution.

What's the Mission?
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to add one of your favorite online learning resources (a blog, a YouTube channel, a tutorial site, etc.) to the list below.

How to Contribute (Your First Pull Request!)
Don't worry, you don't need to install anything! We'll do everything right here on the GitHub website.

Fork this Repository: Click the Fork button in the top-right corner of this page. This creates your own personal copy of this project.

Edit the File: In your newly forked repository, click on this README.md file and then click the little pencil icon ‚úèÔ∏è to start editing.

Add Your Resource: Add a link to your favorite resource at the bottom of the list. Please try to follow this format:

* [Name of the Resource](https://link-to-the-resource.com/) - A brief description of why it's great.

Commit Your Changes: Scroll to the bottom of the page. In the "Commit changes" box, write a short, clear message that describes your contribution. For example: Add The Odin Project to the list. Then, click the green Commit changes
button.

Open a Pull Request: Go back to the main page of your forked repository. You should see a banner that says "This branch is 1 commit ahead...". Click the Contribute button and then Open pull request.

Submit! On the next page, you'll see a summary of your changes. Just click the green Create pull request button.

That's it! You've just asked for your changes to be added to the main project. I'll merge them live during the session.
